## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

The project is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so if you want to build it locally and change things the setup is basically:

```
npm install
npm start
```

That will build and server the project on http://localhost:3000.

`npm run build` will make an optimized production build into the build directory.

You can also check it out through [this live site](https://signup-form-woad.vercel.app/)!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
